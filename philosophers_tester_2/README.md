# Philosophers
In computer science, [The Dining Philosopher Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem) is an example problem often used in concurrent algorithm design to illustrate synchronization issues and techniques for resolving them.

### What is Philosophers?
Philosophers is an individual project at [42](42sp.org.br) that requires us to solve [The Dining Philosopher Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem) problem using threads, processes, mutex and semaphores.
The mandatory part must be solved using [threads](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pthreads.7.html) and [mutex](https://www.unix.com/man-page/linux/5/mutex/). The solution was implemented using a monitoring thread, which checks if any philosopher has died and warns others to stop ([locking mutex](https://linux.die.net/man/3/pthread_mutex_lock)).
The bonus consists of using [processes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/200469/what-is-the-difference-between-a-process-and-a-thread#:~:text=A%20process%20is%20a%20collection,concurrently%20within%20the%20same%20process.) instead of threads and [semaphores](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/sem_overview.7.html) instead of mutex, to solve it the solution used was to implement the death check between the [sleeping](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/usleep.3.html) times, avoiding the problem of reporting the death of a philosopher with more than 10ms.

#### Problem statement
<p>
<img src="./images/dining_philosophers_problem.png" align="right" width="200px"/>
The problem was proposed by <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_Dijkstra">Edsger W. Dijkstra</a> in 1965 and is considered one of the classic problems about operating systems.
The problem consists of five philosophers sitting around a circular dinner table, where each philosopher has a plate for eating spaghetti and a fork to his right. To eat they need 2 forks but there is only one fork between each pair of plates. A philosopher has three actions: eating, thinking, or sleeping. When a philosopher gets hungry he will try to take the fork to his right and to his left, one at a time. If he manages to get both forks, he will eat the food at a certain time and will put the forks on the table, going to sleep and then going to think again.

## Getting started
**Follow the steps below**
<!-- number_of_philosophers time_to_die
time_to_eat time_to_sleep [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat] -->
```bash
# Clone the project and access the folder
git clone https://github.com/wwwwelton/philosophers && cd philosophers/

# Access the folder philo for the program that uses threads and mutex
cd philo

# or

# Access the folder philo_bonus for the program that uses processes and semaphores
cd philo_bonus

# Run make so you can build the program
make

# Run the program with the example arguments
./philo 5 800 200 200 10

# or

# Run the program with the example arguments for the bonus part
./philo_bonus 5 800 200 200 10

# Clean output objects with
make fclean

# Well done!
```

#### Arguments
All arguments working with mandatory and bonus
